# BookHive

BookHive is a web application that allows users to keep track of their personal library collection. Users can add books to their library by providing the book's title, author, and number of pages. The application provides a visually appealing interface where users can view their books, mark books as read or unread, and remove books from their collection. Storage is yet to be added.

## Features

- **Add Book**: Users can click on the "NEW BOOK" button to open a form where they can enter the details of a new book, such as title, author, and number of pages. Upon submission, the book will be added to the library collection.
- **Display Books**: The application displays the user's library collection as a grid of cards. Each card represents a book and includes the book's title, author, number of pages, and a "Remove" button to delete the book from the library.
- **Mark Read/Unread**: Each book card includes a checkbox that allows users to mark a book as read or unread. The status of the book (read or unread) is displayed on the card.
- **Remove Book**: Users can remove a book from their library by clicking on the "Remove" button on the respective book card. The book will be deleted from the library collection.
